## Matrix Factorization for Recommendation: An Example using Netflix data.

Recommendation systems are software tools and techniques [1] used in order to filter massive amounts of information [2] and recommend specific products or items to users that are highly likely to like, and therefore give a high rating. Thus, they are utilized by many commercial areas including, but not limited to movies, news, books, music etc. Many different methods exist for constructing a recommender system such as naive approaches, in which the system calculates the average rating of an item as rated by different users, or calculates the average rating of the items by the same user, and then recommends an item that has a relatively high average rating. In more advanced methods such as collaborative filtering [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], the same items are recommended to "similar" users, these are users that tend to like the same items, and have familiar preferences. Another popular method is called content based approach [1], [2], [3], [6], in which items are recommended to a user because he/she liked similar items in the past. Finally, other approaches include matrix factorization such as, for example, Singular Value Decomposition [7], [8].
